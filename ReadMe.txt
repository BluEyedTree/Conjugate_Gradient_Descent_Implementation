My implementation of conjugate gradient descent on the data set (about student studying) from:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression


The cost function being minimized is the Mean Squared Error of the logistic function. The picture generated shows the beta values that were tried, and the step size used for that iteration.
